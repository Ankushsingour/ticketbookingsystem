        <h2>Qutub Minar History</h2>
        <p>
            Delhi’s Qutub Minar is a five-storied structure constructed over four centuries by a number of rulers. It
            was originally commissioned by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, around 1192 as
            a victory tower. The minaret is named after him; although he wasn’t able to build it beyond the first story.
            His successor Shams-ud-din Iltutmish added three more floors to the structure in 1220. Its topmost story
            suffered damages in 1369 due to lightning. It was reconstructed by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who added the fifth
            and final story to the tower while the entrance to Qutub Minar was built by Sher Shah Suri.
            <br><br>
            Around 300 years later, in 1803, the tower again suffered severe damages in an earthquake. Major Robert
            Smith, a member of the British Indian Army, mended the structure in 1828. He went ahead and installed a
            pillared cupola to sit atop the fifth story, thus lending the tower its sixth story. But this extra story
            was removed in 1848 under the orders of Henry Hardinge, the then Governor-General of India, and reinstalled
            next to the minaret. Entry to the tower has been restricted since 1981 after an accident, which left 47
            people inside it dead.

        </p>


        <h2>Qutub Minar Height & Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The magnificent Qutub Minar has a height of 73 meters. It has a base diameter of 14.3 meters which narrows
            down to 2.7 meters at the top. The structure also includes a spiral staircase of 379 steps. There are many
            other historical edifices around the minaret which, together with the main tower, form the Qutub Minar
            Complex.
<br><br>
            It is widely believed that the tower, which displays early Afghan architectural style, was built taking
            inspiration from the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan. Each of the five distinct stories of the minaret is
            adorned with a projecting balcony supported by intricately designed brackets. While the first three stories
            are built in pale red sandstone, the fourth one is purely made of marble, and the fifth one is a mix of
            marble and sandstone. The architectural styles from the base to the top also differ, thanks to the many
            rulers who constructed it part by part.
<br><br>
            There are bands of inscriptions on different sections of Qutub Minar that narrate its history. Carved verses
            adorn the inside of the tower.
