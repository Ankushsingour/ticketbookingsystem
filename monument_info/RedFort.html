        <h2>Red Fort: History</h2>
        <p>
            The Red Fort was built by none other than the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to serve as the palace fort for his
            capital Shahjahanabad. He commissioned the construction of the fort by the River Yamuna when he decided to
            shift his capital to Delhi from Agra. The construction, which started in 1638, took over 8 years to
            complete. The structure was originally named Qila-i-Mubarak, which means ‘the Blessed Fort’. During its
            history of over three centuries, the fort saw many occupants, including Aurangzeb, Jahandar Shah, Muhammad
            Shah, and Bahadur Shah II, among others.
            <br><br>
            The Red Fort underwent massive destruction in 1739 when the Persian ruler Nadir Shan invaded the city and
            plundered the fort of many valuable artifacts, including the Peacock Throne. Later, during the 1857 Revolt
            against the British, the marble structures of the fort were also destroyed.

        </p>


        <h2>Red Fort Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The fort, which is spread over 255 acres, features a mix of architectural styles such as Islamic, Hindi,
            Timurid, and Persian. Its massive, 2.5-km-long enclosing walls are made of red sandstone and that’s where
            the monument got its name from. A few parts of the fort are also made of red stone while the remaining
            structure is built using marble. The structure, which is in the shape of an irregular octagon, incorporates
            elements of garden design and also features turrets, bastions, pavilions, two gates, and several other
            sections.
        </p>
