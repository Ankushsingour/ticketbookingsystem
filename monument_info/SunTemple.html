        <h2>Konark Sun Temple Information</h2>
        <p>
            Believed to have been built in the 13th century CE the temple was built by the King Narasimhadeva I hailing
            from the Eastern Ganga dynasty between 1238-1250 CE. The temple was commissioned by the king while
            Samantaraya Mahapatra was the one in charge of its construction. ‘Konark’ means the sun and the four
            corners. The temple was called Black Pagoda attributing to its dark facade by the Europeans who used it for
            navigation for their ships. It is said that the temple could draw ships to the shore due to its magnetic
            powers.

        </p>


        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>
            The statue has been built as an ode to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home
            minister of independent India. He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states of the country to
            build the Republic of India.
        </p>
        <h2>Konark Sun Temple Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The temple is known for its impressive Kalinga architecture that includes a depiction of a 100 ft high
            chariot being pulled by horses and wheels carved out of a single stone. The monument portrays the imposing
            chariot of the sun god. Built of Khondalite rocks, the original temple had 230 ft high sanctum which no
            longer exists, 128 ft high audience hall, dance hall, dining hall which survive still. There are 24
            intricately designed wheels, 12 ft in diametre which are seen drawn by horses. These seven horses represent
            the week, the wheels stand for the 12 months while the day-cycle is symbolised by the eight spokes in the
            wheels. And this whole depiction tells how the time is controlled by the sun – being the very illustration
            of the Surya in the Hindu mythology travelling from the east in his chariot escorted by his charioteer,
            Aruna.
            <br><br>

            The entrance leads to the shrine of the deity of Surya made of chlorite stone. The walls of the temple are
            adorned with reliefs – intricate carvings of various figures including Hindu gods, images of the everyday
            mortal life, birds, animals and more. The temple also has erotic sculptures on its shikhara belonging to the
            tantra tradition. The wheels of the temple can be used as sundials and can very well predict the time.
        </p>
