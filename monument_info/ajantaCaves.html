        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of
            which are open to public.These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves
            30–34) caves,each group representing deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as
            monasteries of each respective religion.They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious
            harmony that existed in ancient India.All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty
            (r. 753-982 CE), which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves and the Jain caves. Funding for the
            construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.
        </p>
        <!-- <h2>The Taj Mahal — A Love Symbol</h2> -->
        <p>They are universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist religious art . The caves were built in two phases,
            the first starting around the second century BCE and the second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to
            older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.The site is a protected
            monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India,and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a
            UNESCO World Heritage Site.

            The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Chaityas) and worship-halls (Viharas) of different Buddhist
            traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.The caves also present paintings depicting the past
            lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of
            Buddhist deities.Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as
            a resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.While vivid colours and mural wall painting were
            abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the
            largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.</p>

        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Ajanta Caves includes all the elements necessary to express its Outstanding Universal Value, including the
            ensemble of these caves in its natural setting, sculptures, paintings, and epigraphs. It is of adequate size
            to ensure the complete representation of the features and processes that convey the intense art and
            architectural activity that continued for 800 years, reflecting Buddhist philosophy. It does not suffer from
            adverse effects of development and/or neglect. Interventions undertaken over the years were intended to
            strengthen the structure of the caves. Identified potential threats to the integrity of the property include
            visitor pressure in the painted caves, overall management of the protected site, structural stability of the
            caves including loose boulders, and capacity of the staff at the property.
        </p>

        <h2>Authenticity</h2>
        <p>
            The authenticity of Ajanta Caves is expressed through the architectural forms of chaityagrihas and viharas
            as well as the schemes used in decorating these spaces, such as sculptures and painted panels depicting
            various Buddhist traditions. Its location and setting, as well as its materials and substance, are likewise
            authentically associated with the history of Buddhism and with two important eras in the history of India.
        </p>

        <h2>Protection and management requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The management of Ajanta Caves is with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), while the management of the
            buffer zone comes under stakeholders including the ASI, Forest Department, and Government of Maharashtra
            through various legislation such as the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (1958)
            and Rules (1959), Indian Forest Act (1927), and Forest Conservation Act (1980). These regulate any type of
            activity in prohibited and regulated areas, which extend 100 m and 200 m respectively from the protected
            site. Implementation of a Comprehensive Conservation Management Plan for the property is under way.
<br>
            Sustaining the Outstanding Universal Value of the property over time will require addressing vital issues
            such as controlling the visitor pressure in the painted caves; overall management of the protected site;
            structural monitoring in the caves, monitoring the loose boulders; and capacity building of the staff at the
            property
