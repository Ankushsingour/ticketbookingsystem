        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of
            which are open to public.These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves
            30–34) caves,each group representing deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as
            monasteries of each respective religion.They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious
            harmony that existed in ancient India.All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty
            (r. 753-982 CE), which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves and the Jain caves. Funding for the
            construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.
        </p>
        <!-- <h2>The Taj Mahal — A Love Symbol</h2> -->
        <p>They are universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist religious art . The caves were built in two phases,
            the first starting around the second century BCE and the second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to
            older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.The site is a protected
            monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India,and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a
            UNESCO World Heritage Site.

            The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Chaityas) and worship-halls (Viharas) of different Buddhist
            traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.The caves also present paintings depicting the past
            lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of
            Buddhist deities.Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as
            a resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.While vivid colours and mural wall painting were
            abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the
            largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.</p>
