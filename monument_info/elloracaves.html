        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The invaluable ensemble of 34 caves at Ellora in the Charanandri hills of western India’s Maharashtra State
            showcases a spirit of co-existence and religious tolerance through the outstanding architectural activities
            carried out by the followers of three prominent religions: Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. The rock-cut
            activity was carried out in three phases from the 6th century to the 12th century. The earliest caves (caves
            1–12), excavated between the 5th and 8th centuries, reflect the Mahayana philosophy of Buddhism then
            prevalent in this region. The Brahmanical group of caves (caves 13–29), including the renowned Kailasa
            temple (cave 16), was excavated between the 7th and 10th centuries. The last phase, between the 9th and 12th
            centuries, saw the excavation of a group of caves (caves 30–34) reflecting Jaina philosophy.

        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Ellora Caves includes all the elements necessary to express its Outstanding Universal Value, including the
            architectural and sculptural elements that bear witness to Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism in an
            uninterrupted sequence of monuments from AD 600 to 1000. The property, which encompasses the ensemble along
            with its natural setting, is of adequate size to ensure the complete representation of features and
            processes that convey the property’s significance, and does not suffer from adverse effects of development
            and/or neglect. Identified potential threats to the integrity of the property include visitor and
            environmental management, seepage and cracking in the caves, and the capacity of conservation staff at the
            property.
        </p>

        <h2>Authenticity</h2>
        <p>
            The authenticity of Ellora Caves is expressed through the architectural forms and designs such as the
            viharas (monasteries), chaityagriha (sanctuary), and monolithic temples belonging to three different faiths.
            The materials, locations, and natural setting also play significant roles in determining the authenticity of
            the property. The Ellora Caves are authentic in terms of the forms and designs, materials and substance, and
            locations and setting of paintings, rock-cut architecture, sculptures, and unfinished temples of three
            different faiths, i.e. Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism.
        </p>

        <h2>Protection and management requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The management of the Ellora Caves is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), while the
            buffer zones are jointly managed by the ASI, the Forest Department, and the Government of Maharashtra.
            Various legislation, including the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (1958) and its
            Rules (1959), Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act (2010),
            Forest Act (1927), Forest Conservation Act (1980), Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial
            Townships Act, Maharashtra (1965), and Regional and Town Planning Act, Maharashtra (1966), governs the
            overall administration of the property and its buffer zones. A detailed condition survey of all caves has
            been undertaken as a part of the Comprehensive Conservation Management Plan and implementation is underway.
