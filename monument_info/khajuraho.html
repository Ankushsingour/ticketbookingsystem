        <h2>About Khajuraho</h2>
        <p>
            Khajuraho one of the most famous town of India is located in the Chatarpur district in the state of Madhya
            Pradesh. This famed city is known for its temple complexes, erotic sculptures and pristine beauty. Khajuraho
            is dotted with numerous Hindu and Jain temples dating back to medieval era. What make these temples truly
            breathtaking are their sensuous sculptures that have attracted tourist for decades. The explicit and
            enticing frescoes have had both historians and tourists enthralled for many a millennium now. Spread over an
            area of approximately 20 sq.kms in the northeastern part of Madhya Pradesh, Khajuraho is a major tourist
            site and also listed among the 14 UNESCO world heritage sites in India

        <p>
            These temples were built over a thousand years ago under the patronage of the Rajput Chandela kings in a
            span of 100 years from 950 to 1050 A.D. The first recorded mention of the Khajuraho temples is in the
            accounts of Abu Rihan al Biruni (AD 1022) and the Arab Traveller Ibn Battuta (AD 1335). The exact reason as
            to why these temples were built and their significance eludes our understanding even today. But it is
            believed that the Chandela kings were followers of the tantric cult, which believed that gratification of
            earthly desires is the way to attain the divine. Though known for the eroticism depicted on the temple
            walls, it is only the western group of temples, which have these sculptures. The eastern and southern groups
            are largely temples in the traditional sense with religious sculptures engraved in it.

        <h2>Brief History of Khajuraho</h2>
        <p>
            The history of Khajuraho is quite interesting. The name Khajuraho is derived from “Kharjuravahaka”, which
            comprises of Sanskrit words, kharjura = date palm and vahaka = "one who carries". It was literally a small
            village which bordered by Date palm trees and its existence was a well kept secret till the British
            historian T.S.Burt discovered it in 1838. These temples at Khajuraho were built by the Chandela rulers in
            the span of a hundered years from 950-1050AD, but abandoned in the 14th century. It was once the cultural
            capital of the Chandela rulers and still retains much of its ancient glory even though only about 22 of the
            85 original temples still exist there.
